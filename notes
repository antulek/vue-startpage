features
-search functionality

style hierarchy:
-scoped style inside vue component - most basic styling, that holds very basic structure of site and elements
-main.css - basic paddings and rules that make basic site look 'good enough', or rules that are needed by all themes
-theme.css - sits atop of everything else, changes basic site into anything you want
--default.css - default theme
*colorscheme.[css/js/vue] - some strict definition of colors used in page

fun features
-typing part of site name to show only those that fit query - {https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fzmx3rlyqyqfa1.gif}

todo
[x]create a rough layout
[x]-make it mobile friendly
[x]-split elements of site into separate components
[x]-modules extends main module component
[x]communications, common event bus between all components

Core element and data flow between them
1)query area
2)categories and sites
3)category/site form
4)import/export

Data schema for modules:
themes:
-themeList[]
-currentTheme
categories:
-categories
-name
-icon
-color
--sites[]
---name
---address
---search_address
---icon
---color
---subsites[]

modules interaction with data:
1 - pressing search/lucky button when query was typed
1+2 - pressing site button when query was typed
2 - changing order of sites/categories, moving site to different category
3 - addding/editing site/category
4 - importing exporting sites
4 + x - importing/exporting data from different modules


roadblocks
-communications, common event bus between all components
-how much you can fetch and embed into site from external sites (xkcd comic)
-how to enable/disable modules
-how to order modules on mobile and desktop
